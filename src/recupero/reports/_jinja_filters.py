"""Shared Jinja filters for defense-in-depth XSS hardening.

Recupero renders HTML deliverables (briefs, legal-request letters,
victim summaries, freeze digests, portfolio dashboards) that downstream
get opened in operator browsers or attached to emails. Jinja autoescape
defends against `{{ value }}` interpolation, but it does NOT defend
against two attribute-context attacks that come up across our templates:

  1. ``href="{{ url }}"`` where ``url`` could be ``javascript:alert(1)``
     or ``data:text/html,...`` — autoescape escapes the quote character
     but a `javascript:` URL doesn't need a quote to fire.
  2. CRLF injection into an attribute that the browser later treats as
     a header (rare in static HTML, but a hardening-affordance for our
     monitoring-dispatcher emails which run the same templates).

We solve both with one small filter, ``safe_url``, registered on every
Jinja Environment that renders an `href`/`src`-bearing template.

Threat model in scope:
  * On-chain labels (Etherscan tag set is attacker-controllable for new
    addresses).
  * Issuer freeze-outcome responses (compliance teams might paste
    arbitrary text into the followup field).
  * Address-display names from Investigator handoff JSON.
  * The interactive-graph JSON blob (already separately defended in
    graph_ui.py at the data layer).

Threat model NOT in scope:
  * Backend-generated explorer URLs from
    `recupero._common.ADDRESS_EXPLORER_BY_CHAIN` — these come from a
    fixed allowlist. ``safe_url`` is defense-in-depth against a future
    bug that lets attacker-controlled bytes reach the URL field.
